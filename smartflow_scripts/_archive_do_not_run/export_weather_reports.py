- Weather Features: Temperature, Rainfall (mm), Wind Speed, Humidity
- Model Selection Criteria: Lowest WMAPE, MASE < 1.0 (Must outperform naive baseline), Positive R2

[REJECTED] SARIMAX (Univariate Exogenous)
  - MAE             = 800,380.14
  - RMSE            = 913,053.15
  - WMAPE           = 51.32%
  - MASE            = 3.1684 (REJECTED: Worse than naive baseline)
  - R2 Score        = -9.5836

================================================================================
CONCLUSION:
Prophet and LSTM with weather regressors achieved superior accuracy (WMAPE 10.48% and 13.62%).
Univariate models were rejected due to inability to adapt to non-linear weather shocks.
