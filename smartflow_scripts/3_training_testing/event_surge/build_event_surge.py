Event surge, measured from the corridor's own history.

WHAT THIS REPLACES
  gold.ml_event_surge_forecast held three hand-entered rows:

      Bocaue Exit    62,300 -> 115,878   (1.86x)
      Marilao Exit   45,000 ->  52,100   (1.16x)
      Balagtas Exit  38,000 ->  41,500   (1.09x)

  Round numbers, no date, no provenance, and no row anywhere in
  gold.ml_model_metrics scoring an event-surge model. Nothing was trained and
  nothing was tested; the dashboard's "Prophet" badge was a hardcoded string.
  The panel then multiplied those invented ratios onto REAL observed baselines,
  which is what made the output look measured.

WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD
  No event calendar was supplied, so event days are IDENTIFIED FROM THE DATA:
  the Philippine Arena is served by the CDV/PH Arena exit, so an event shows up
  as that exit running far above its own normal level for that weekday and
  month. Days above a threshold are taken as event days.

  Then, for every exit, the uplift on those days is measured against the same
  weekday-and-month median computed from NON-event days only. That gives an
  observed multiplier per exit, with a sample size and a spread.

HONEST LIMITS, carried into the table so the panel can show them
  - Event days are INFERRED, not supplied. A large non-event disruption on the
    corridor could be mislabelled as an event.
  - The uplift is a historical average of what happened, not a forecast of what
    a future event will do. It is a scenario input.
  - It cannot be split by event type or attendance; those are not in the data.
