Event surge — an actual out-of-sample test.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  build_event_surge.py MEASURES what happened on past event days. That is a
  descriptive statistic, not a forecast: it was never asked to predict anything
  it had not already seen, so "trained and tested" could not honestly be
  claimed for it.

  This asks the operational question instead: if you take the uplift observed on
  PAST events and use it to predict the NEXT one, how close do you get?

PROTOCOL
  Event days are split CHRONOLOGICALLY - earlier events train, later events are
  held out and never touched while fitting. Per-exit uplift is computed from the
  training events only, then applied to each held-out event day's matched
  weekday/month baseline (itself computed from non-event days before the cut).
  Scored on predicted vs actual vehicles at each exit on each held-out event day.

MODELS — the five in the diagram's Event-Based & Holiday box
  Prophet, XGBoost, SARIMAX, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.

  ADAPTATION, stated rather than hidden: the diagram says "Gradient Boosting
  CLASSIFIER", but the output this panel serves is extra vehicles per exit and
  the box's own KPI for it is WMAPE — a regression metric. A classifier cannot
  produce that. The regressor is used and the substitution is recorded here.

  Per-exit uplift is kept alongside them as a deliberately simple benchmark. It
  is the diagram's descriptive "control-day comparison" carried into prediction,
  and a candidate that cannot beat it is not earning its complexity.

BASELINES IT MUST BEAT
  no-event      pretend nothing is happening - just the normal-day baseline.
                This is the bar that matters: if the uplift table cannot beat
                it, the panel adds nothing over ignoring events entirely.
  flat-uplift   one corridor-wide average multiplier for every exit, which tests
                whether the PER-EXIT detail earns its place.

Nothing here is transcribed; every figure is computed on each run and written to
gold.ml_model_metrics under target 'Event Surge'.
