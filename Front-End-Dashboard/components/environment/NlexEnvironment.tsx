/**
 * The NLEX environment behind the whole app (7 Oct 2026, the user's brief).
 *
 * The scene is the user's own artwork: public/light_bg.png by day and
 * public/dark_bg.png at night (served as the WebP copies beside them), an
 * expressway curving in from the bottom right under an elevated road and a
 * skyline. Over it drift three depths of clouds at their own speeds, with a
 * soft light that slowly moves, and a veil that keeps text readable.
 *
 *   sky colour -> background art -> sun haze -> far clouds -> mid clouds ->
 *   near clouds -> readability veil
 *
 * Only the clouds (and the soft light) move, as CSS transform and opacity; the
 * art itself stays put and does not follow the pointer (user request). The
 * same scene, at the same strength, sits behind every page, tab and sub-tab,
 * the Live Map included; `scene` marks the Overview ("hero") for styling
 * hooks. Reduced motion and the Effects switch hold everything still.
 * Decorative only: aria-hidden, no pointer events.
