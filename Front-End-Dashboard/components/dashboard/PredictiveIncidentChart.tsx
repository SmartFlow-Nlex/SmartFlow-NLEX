          Accidents are only ~12% of daily incidents, so a fit tuned to the combined count is tuned to breakdowns: on the current
          holdout, scaling the blended forecast down to an accident estimate does worse than simply assuming the historical average,
          and this dedicated model beats it clearly. Its own skill is modest, though — without traffic volume it is not clearly better
          than the historical average (re-measured 2026-09-21). <strong>Breakdowns are derived, not separately modeled</strong> (blended
          forecast minus accident forecast): a dedicated breakdown model was tested and did no better than the blended fit. Metrics
          below describe the blended forecast.
