 * Forecasted fleet composition — the modelling diagram's second Emission
 * Forecasting box.
 *
 * Every number comes from GET /api/emissions/fleet-mix, which serves
 * gold.ml_predictive_fleet_mix, written by
 * smartflow_scripts/3_training_testing/fleet_mix/train_fleet_mix.py.
 *
 * WHY A STACKED AREA AND NOT THREE LINES
 *
 *   The three class shares are a composition: they sum to 100% by definition,
 *   so they are not three independent series that happen to share an axis. Drawn
 *   as separate lines, a reader has to add them up mentally to see that Class 1
 *   giving up a point is Class 2 or 3 taking it. Stacked to 100%, that trade is
 *   the shape of the chart.
 *
 * WHY THE FORECAST IS A SEPARATE, PALER BAND
 *
 *   Actuals and predictions on one continuous surface read as one measured
 *   series, which is exactly the claim the panel must not make. The projection
 *   is drawn in the same colours at reduced opacity with a marked boundary, so
 *   where the evidence stops is visible without reading a legend.

            Ranked by Aitchison distance, the standard metric for compositional data — MAPE divides by the actual
            value, so on a fleet that is ~79% Class 1 and ~9% Class 3 it scores the same absolute miss ten times
            harder on the rarest class. <b>SKILL</b> is the ratio against a persistence baseline; below 1 means the
            model beats assuming the mix does not change. {champ?.split_label ? `Protocol: ${champ.split_label}.` : ""}
