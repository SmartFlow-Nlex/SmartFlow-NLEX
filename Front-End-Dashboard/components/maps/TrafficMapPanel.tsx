         each zoom step while the interpolation doubles, holding roughly 15 m
         either side of the centreline, which is about NLEX's separation.

         Below z15 it cannot be honoured. Two ribbons 15 m apart are a fifth of
         a pixel at z12, so drawing them faithfully would merge them into one
         line — and an offset smaller than half the line width makes them
         overlap into a single band with no roadbed showing between, which is

             The difference is not cosmetic -- the two maps know different

             Waze gives every jam its own LINESTRING and its own length_meters,
             and the two agree to the metre, so on the live map the exact extent
             of each queue is known. Painting this ribbon with the worst jam
             ANYWHERE in its exit-to-exit segment threw that away: the segments
             run several kilometres, so a 300 m queue at one end turned the whole
             span red and the map showed far more congestion than the feed
             contained. The colour now lives on jam-extent below, over the length
             each queue actually occupies, and this is the road under it.

             The forecast now works the same way. The model predicts one
             state per exit, and each predicted jam carries the typical queue
             length and distance from the plaza for that exit and hour, from
             four years of Waze history, so withPredictedQueues draws it over
             that length and this ribbon is the green road under it. A forecast
             segment is coloured whole only when it has no queue to draw, and
             grey still means nobody forecast that stretch. */

                 flowing, and green states that. Grey would have claimed the

         Drawn with a scrolling line-pattern rather than an animated
         line-dasharray. Dashes cannot loop smoothly: with a pattern
         [lead, gap, rest] of constant period, the lit block slides by
         (period - gap) and then jumps back by the gap. Here that was a 4-unit
         jump in a 7-unit period, so the light crawled forward and snapped back
         57% of the way, every cycle, on every ribbon. That snap is what read as
         glitching, and it cannot be tuned out — the jump *is* the gap, so it
         only shrinks by making the line almost solid, at which point there is
         no dash left to travel.

         A pattern image has no such seam. The pulse fades to nothing at both
         edges of the image, so however far it is scrolled the tiles still meet
         at zero and the motion is continuous. Scrolling is done by rewriting
         the image, which is 2 KB, rather than by re-evaluating a paint property
         on six layers.

         Six images: two carriageways x three speed tiers. Two carriageways
         because the pulse has to travel north on one and south on the other.
         Three tiers because the speed is the message — a free stretch races and
         a standstill crawls, so the eye reads rate the way it reads colour. */

         An earlier build drew Waze's jam lines raw and they landed beside and
         across the corridor rather than on it -- the geometry follows Waze's
         own road graph, not ours. They were dropped for that reason and the
         colour folded into the ribbon instead, which is what spread one short
         queue across a whole segment.

         What makes them drawable now is the snap in the loader above: each jam
         is projected onto the corridor centreline and given the direction it
         belongs to, so it rides the same ribbon at the same offset. Only jams
         the snapper resolved are drawn -- one it could not keeps its raw Waze
         geometry, and direction_source is absent, so it is filtered out here
         rather than drawn off-road. */

         that made short congestion hard to find even once it was drawn in the
         right place. An outline gives it an edge, and an edge is what makes a
         small mark register as an object rather than as noise on the ribbon.
         Cheap, and it never overstates: the casing is centred on the queue, so
         it grows the mark sideways, never along the road. */

         The jam overlay came back, as jam-extent above. It had been removed
         because Waze's raw lines landed beside and across the corridor and
         disagreed with the ribbon wherever they overlapped -- but the fix for
         that was the snapper, not deleting the layer. Folding the colour into

         broadly across it: opening horizontally clears the road, and the only

           So the pins are thinned by what is actually on screen rather than by
           a zoom threshold: walking south to north, a pin is kept if it is far
           enough from the last one kept, and hidden otherwise. Zooming in
           spreads them out and the hidden ones come back on their own. Nothing
