         means a wildly varying real one. Above z15 that matters and the

         each zoom step while the interpolation doubles, holding roughly 15 m
         either side of the centreline, which is about NLEX's separation.

         Below z15 it cannot be honoured. Two ribbons 15 m apart are a fifth of
         a pixel at z12, so drawing them faithfully would merge them into one
         line — and an offset smaller than half the line width makes them
         overlap into a single band with no roadbed showing between, which is
         exactly what a 2 px floor did here. The floor is therefore set by the

             southbound, so the marker and the "starts at" attribution were
             pointing at the wrong end of better than half of them.

             The geometry itself is left in corridor order on purpose: the
             ribbons are drawn from it with line-offset, whose side depends on
             the direction the line runs, and the flow patterns scroll along
             it. Reversing the coordinates would move southbound queues onto

             run several kilometres, so a 300 m queue at one end turned the whole
             span red and the map showed far more congestion than the feed
             contained. The colour now lives on jam-extent below, over the length
             each queue actually occupies, and this is the road under it.

             The model has no such extent. It predicts ONE state per
             exit-to-exit segment -- that is its unit of prediction, not a
             summary of something finer -- so colouring the whole segment is the
             honest rendering there, and narrowing it to part of the road would

         [lead, gap, rest] of constant period, the lit block slides by
         (period - gap) and then jumps back by the gap. Here that was a 4-unit
         jump in a 7-unit period, so the light crawled forward and snapped back

         the image, which is 2 KB, rather than by re-evaluating a paint property
         on six layers.

         Six images: two carriageways x three speed tiers. Two carriageways
         because the pulse has to travel north on one and south on the other.
         Three tiers because the speed is the message — a free stretch races and

         Call this IMMEDIATELY BEFORE the layer that uses it. An animated image
         registered while no layer references it is never staged into a pattern
         atlas, and adding the layer later does not stage it: the layer then
         draws nothing at all, silently. That is exactly why the queue flow was
         invisible while the ribbon's worked -- the mid and slow images were
         built up here and first referenced a hundred lines further down. The
         proof was a plain non-animated image added at that later point, which

           So the pins are thinned by what is actually on screen rather than by
           a zoom threshold: walking south to north, a pin is kept if it is far
           enough from the last one kept, and hidden otherwise. Zooming in

         appear to travel. Stepping NB forward and SB backward through the same
         sequence is what makes the two carriageways run opposite ways.

         Each tier keeps its own clock, so the fast ribbon advances roughly
         seven times for every one step of the standstill ribbon. One rAF loop
         drives all of them rather than three timers, and it parks itself when

                The live feed is one snapshot, so the line above is only this
                report's own publication: a hazard at a site that has been
                reported on and off for weeks still reads as an hour old. The
                warehouse remembers every report it has ingested, so this is the
                earliest of them within 150 m, of this same kind.

                Not windowed, by request -- it reaches back as far as the
                history goes, which on this corridor is currently about seven
                weeks. That makes it a fact about the PLACE, not about this
                problem, and the count is shown beside it so it cannot be read
                as one unbroken closure: "64 reports here since 7 Aug" says what
                it is. With no earlier record the first report is this one, and
                the line says so rather than inventing a date. */}
