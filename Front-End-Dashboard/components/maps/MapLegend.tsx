/**
 * The one legend, shared by the panel and the maximised view.
 *
 * This is the maximised view's key, which reads better than the panel's did:
 * the two things a reader needs — what the colours on the road mean and what
 * the pins are — and nothing else. The panel's version had grown a direction
 * section and a plaza row on top of that, which is more to read than the map
 * needs explaining, and it drew its densities in colours that were not even the
 * map's.
 *
 * Nothing here is written by hand. The densities come from the map's own
 * palette and the reports from WAZE_REPORT_TYPES, which is also the list the
 * map draws and the Active Reports tile counts, so the key cannot describe a
 * map other than the one beside it.
