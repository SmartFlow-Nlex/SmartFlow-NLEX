/**
 * One carriageway's worth of simulation: its own TrafficSim, its own scenario
 * events and their engine binding, its own manual interventions, demand
 * anchoring and metrics/baseline. Called exactly twice — once per Direction —
 * regardless of which view (NB / SB / Both) is selected; the inactive
 * direction's sim simply is not stepped or rendered (see the rAF loop in
 * page.tsx), which is what keeps NB-only and SB-only behaviourally identical
 * to the single-sim page this replaces.
 *
 * What is per-direction here (sim, bindings, events, metrics, baseline, lane
 * count, inflow, demand/plaza data, every manual-intervention field) versus
 * what the caller keeps shared (the km window, sim speed, running/paused,
 * warm-up, hour of day) follows the split agreed in Phase D1/D2: see that
 * report for the reasoning. Two independent EngineBindings — one per call —
 * because createEngineBinding() closes over private ownership state; reusing
 * one binding for two sims would let each direction's "who owns the closure
 * right now" answer stomp on the other's (see verify.ts's binding-isolation
 * checks).
