/* ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   REPLAY — scrub back over what just happened

   An incident in this sandbox is over in seconds. An operator watching the
   metrics, or reading the scenario panel, or simply looking at the other
   carriageway, misses the moment the lane blocks and has no way back to it:
   the only controls are play, pause and reset, and reset throws the run away.

   So every step is recorded and can be played back. Deliberately NOT a
   rewind of the engine — restoring a microsimulation to an earlier state
   means restoring every driver's reaction phase and the RNG cursor with it,
   and any mistake there silently changes the run the operator is judging.
   This records the PICTURE instead: enough of each frame to redraw it exactly,
   and nothing that could feed back into the physics.

   The consequence is worth stating plainly, because it shapes what the button
   can offer: you can review what happened, but you cannot resume from the
   middle of it and get a different outcome. Rewinding and letting go returns
   you to the live simulation, which has carried on the whole time.
