/* Twelve vehicles per carriageway, across three lanes, and they drive the road
 * they are on.
 *
 * Twelve cars at a fixed pace were decoration and had to say so, because a
 * stream of traffic running at the same speed over a red stretch contradicts
 * the red stretch. A car that CRAWLS where the band is red and runs where the
 * road is clear says the same thing the colours say, in the one language that
 * needs no key at all -- a reader watching it hesitate at Meycauayan has read
 * the panel without reading anything.
 *
 * They all share ONE speed profile, built once from the bands, and differ only
 * in where they start. That is what keeps them honest: every car slows over
 * the same stretch, so none can be seen sailing through a queue another is
 * stuck in. It also gives the bunching for free -- a constant head start in
 * TIME is a shrinking gap in SPACE wherever the road is slow, so they close up
 * inside a queue and string out again on clear tarmac, which is what traffic
 * does.
 *
 * Measured on the running panel: a car crosses a red band at 0.51% of the
 * track per second against 4.26% on clear road, so the crawl is 8.4x slower
 * than the run.
 *
 * The speeds are not measurements. This panel knows a queue's class, not the
 * speed of the traffic in it, so the figures below are chosen for order and
 * legibility: red slower than amber slower than clear. The measurements are
 * the band, and the metres and delay on the rail above it.

/* Twelve of them, and not twelve of the same thing: an expressway carries
 * buses and container trucks as well as cars, and a strip of identical dashes
 * reads as a pattern where a mixed stream reads as traffic.
 *
 * No motorcycles. NLEX does not allow them on the mainline, and a panel about
 * this road should not show something that cannot be on it.
 *
 * The heavy vehicles are all in one lane, which is both how they are driven
 * and what makes the spacing work. Vehicles in a lane share a profile and
 * differ only in phase, so the gap between two of them is smallest in the
 * slowest zone, and it has to stay wider than the vehicle in front. Worked out
 * for the worst case -- a queue present, so there is a slow zone at all, and
 * the track at its narrowest 940 px:
 *
 *   lane 1   5 cars      gap 27 px   car 18 px
 *   lane 2   4 mixed     gap 34 px   van 22 px
 *   lane 3   3 heavy     gap 45 px   bus 28 px
 *
 * so they close right up in a queue, which is the point, and still cannot
 * overlap. A fifth heavy vehicle in lane 3 would break that.
 *
 * Those are bounds, not readings. Measured on the running panel with the
 * queues that happened to be live, the tightest gap seen was 86 px behind an
 * 18 px car, with no overlap at any sampled frame.

   direction from bearing rather than from the street name Waze supplies. That
   was enough for this panel to call a stretch congested on the strength of a
   jam the map had discarded.

   Absence is information here: Waze only emits a record where there IS a jam, so
   an exit with no recent row is flowing freely. Every exit therefore starts clear

               - Attribution. A block in Angeles' column is the road between
                 Angeles and Dau, so a jam belonging to Dau turned Angeles
                 orange while the rail said Angeles was CLEAR.
               - Scale. The segment used Waze's raw 0-5 level, the rail used
                 classify(). Level 1 is "slow" to classify() and green on the
                 level palette, so Paso de Blas read SLOW over a green road.

             One source now, so the block, the words beside it and the chips
             above it cannot disagree. Gradation survives: the level still
             picks the shade, but only within the band its own status allows,
             so a level-4 jam is deeper than a level-3 and nothing classed
             slow can ever render green. */
