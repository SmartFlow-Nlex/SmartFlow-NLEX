   SCENARIO CATALOGUE

   What an operator can ask the sandbox to stage, and which of the engine's own
   levers each scenario pulls. Nothing here simulates anything: a scenario is a
   recipe for the existing Interventions (closedLanes / closurePoint /
   closureEnd / incidents / speedLimitKmh / speedZone), and the engine does the
   rest.

   Durations come from calibration.json (data). Accident phase splits, lanes
   blocked, lengths and speeds come from assumptions.ts (not data). A breakdown's
   phase split is measured (the response share in calibration.json), so its
   second phase has no fixed offset: it is set per event. This file holds only
   structure: names, labels, ordering, defaults and which resources are used.
