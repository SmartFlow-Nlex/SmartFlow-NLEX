   SCENARIO ASSUMPTIONS

   Everything in this file is a value that does NOT come from NLEX data. Each one
   is an `Assumption`: it carries its value, why it was chosen, what data (if
   any) informed it without determining it, and what would settle it.

   What DOES come from data lives in calibration.json (duration quantiles, the
   breakdown response share) and is documented there. The line between the two
   is deliberate: a number in this file is a modelling choice a reviewer is
   entitled to argue with.

   Nothing here changes the engine. The engine's own Interventions
   (closedLanes / closurePoint / closureEnd / incidents / speedLimitKmh /
   speedZone) are the only levers a scenario can pull.

Real flooding affects outer lanes first (they sit lower, nearer the shoulder drain) and is class-dependent: standing water shallow enough for a truck's higher ground clearance to pass can still stop a car. A single lane, closed uniformly to every class, does not represent either of those things; it is only the nearest available approximation. Overturned vehicle and scheduled roadworks do NOT share this limitation, despite also being single-lane closures with an assumed length: both are genuine physical obstructions that block every vehicle class equally (a car cannot pass an overturned truck's wreckage, or a roadworks barrier, any more than another truck could), so a binary closure is not a simplification for them the way it is for flood — there is no real per-class or outer-lanes-first behaviour being flattened away.",

DERIVED from one NLEx study, not measured here: Mejia & Sigua (2018) fitted speed-density curves to NLEx loop-detector data by rainfall class (PAGASA classes: light 0.1-2.5 mm/h, moderate 2.6-7.5, heavy above 7.5) and report a free-flow speed of 109.79 km/h in clear weather, 102.12 light, 101.46 moderate and 97.66 heavy (their Table 2).

Light and moderate come out the same because the study's own figures for them differ by under 1 km/h (its average speeds by 0.7 km/h): the data do not separate them, so the cap does not either. A SPEED CAP IS ONLY A PROXY. Rain's main real effect is on following headways — drivers keep larger gaps — and the engine cannot vary headway, so a cap reproduces the speed effect and likely UNDERSTATES the capacity loss.
