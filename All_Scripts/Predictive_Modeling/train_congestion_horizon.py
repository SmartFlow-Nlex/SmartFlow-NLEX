Congestion state forecasting — a REAL 1-to-12-hour horizon.

WHY THIS REPLACES train_congestion_multi.py
  That script never forecast anything. It built its training frame as

      full = pd.concat([df.assign(horizon=hz) for hz in HORIZONS])

  which duplicates every row twelve times and tags each copy with a horizon,
  but never shifts the TARGET. All twelve copies carry the state at the SAME
  timestamp, so `horizon` had no relationship to the label, the models correctly
  learned to ignore it, and every horizon returned an identical answer. The
  served map showed one prediction twelve times (verified: every segment had
  exactly one distinct state/probability pair across all twelve columns).

  A second, independent bug had the same effect on serving: inside the GRU's
  horizon loop the input window `a[-SEQ_LEN:, :]` was recomputed identically on
  every pass, so it never advanced through the horizons either.

  The reported 78.1% was therefore a NOWCAST accuracy - classifying the current
  hour from lag-24/lag-48 features - mislabelled as a 12-hour forecast.

WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD
  For each horizon h, the target is the state at ts + h hours for that exit, and
  the features are the ones knowable at ts. Accuracy is reported PER HORIZON,
  because a single number across 1-12h hides exactly the decay that matters.

LEAKAGE
  A training row is kept only if its TARGET timestamp also falls before the test
  cut. Splitting on ts alone would let a row at ts = cut - 1h carry a label from
  inside the test window.

EXPECTATION
  Accuracy will fall well below 78.1%, steeply with horizon. That is not a
  regression; it is the first honest measurement of a harder task.

#   1. Targets are looked up by TIMESTAMP, not by shifting rows. The two eras
#      are not contiguous (nobody collected 20 Apr - 3 Aug 2026), and a
#      positional shift paired an April hour with an August answer.
#   2. History counts distinct jams per exit-hour, the live feed counts jam
#      rows, and the scales differ (about 13.6 vs 6.4 a jam-hour). History
#      counts are rescaled to the live scale so the count features mean the
#      same thing in both eras.
# History rows enter the fit with ONE randomly drawn horizon each rather than
# every horizon (four years x every horizon is tens of millions of rows); the
# live weeks keep every horizon, and every horizon is still predicted.

# These sat in the same transaction as the write below, so for as long as that
# took - 3,360 single-row inserts across the Atlantic, minutes - every reader
# of this table was blocked. The dashboard's forecast map, its horizon picker
# and its model card all read it, so all three died together once an hour and
# came back on their own, which is a hard fault to catch in the act.
#
# Committing the DDL separately leaves the data write holding only ROW
# EXCLUSIVE, which readers do not queue behind: they keep seeing the previous
# forecast until the new one lands.
