SmartFlow NLEX — Incident Spatial Models (Block 1: Incident Probability Prediction)
====================================================================================
Two per-EXIT models, sibling to train_incident_models.py's per-DAY pipeline:

  1. GWR (Geographically Weighted Regression) — one row per exit (N=20), a
     genuinely spatial regression: does the local relationship between an
     exit's incident concentration and its structural traits (corridor
     position, access-point count, typical traffic volume) vary along the
     corridor? Fit once, explanatory rather than a day-ahead forecaster —
     see the doc comment on fit_gwr() for why it is scored in-sample.

  2. Spatial LSTM — a single LSTM (shared weights across all 20 exits, one
     training example per exit-day) that sees each exit's own recent incident
     history AND a spatial-lag feature (its nearest neighbours' recent
     counts), trained with a Poisson loss and genuinely holdout-validated.
     This is the one that produces the 24-hour high-risk segment ranking.

Why a second script rather than extending train_incident_models.py: that
pipeline works at daily-national granularity (one row per calendar day) and
has no spatial dimension at all. GWR and a spatial LSTM need per-exit
geography, which is a different data shape end to end — a new script keeps
that shape change from leaking into the (working, unrelated) 7-model daily
comparison.

Why PyTorch instead of the TensorFlow/Keras the daily pipeline's LSTM/GRU
use: this machine's Python (3.14) has no TensorFlow wheel yet — the daily
pipeline's own LSTM/GRU already can't run here either, a pre-existing gap
this script does not attempt to fix. PyTorch publishes cp314 wheels, so it is
what makes a real (not simulated) LSTM possible in this environment today.

Several small helpers here (get_conn, load_daily_rain, calendar_features,
the exit-reference SQL) mirror code that already lives in
train_incident_models.py and src/services/map-comparison.service.ts.
Duplicated rather than imported — importing train_incident_models would
pull in its module-level `import tensorflow`, which fails outright in this
environment — and kept in sync by hand, the same convention this codebase
already uses everywhere a Python/TS pair needs to agree (see e.g.
PRED_COLUMN's sync comment in train_incident_models.py).

Incident source: silver.nlex_accident_events_clean / nlex_breakdown_events_clean
(the client's real accident/breakdown exports), resolved to an exit by
nearest corridor_km — migrated off the legacy nlex_road_crashes/
nlex_motorcycle_crashes/nlex_stalled_vehicles free-text `location` join,
which parsed "Km N" out of location strings using the DPWH km-post
convention and compared it directly against the Balintawak-relative exit
list with no offset correction (the same bug already found and fixed in
incident-severity.service.ts). corridor_km is a plain numeric column on the
client tables, already on the exit list's scale, so this needed no regex
and has no unresolved-location case any more.

Usage:
    python train_incident_spatial_models.py                 # train + report only
    python train_incident_spatial_models.py --write-db       # + write to gold.*
    python train_incident_spatial_models.py --dry-write       # rehearse the write, then roll back
