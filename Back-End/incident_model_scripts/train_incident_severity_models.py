SmartFlow NLEX — Incident Severity/Clearance Models (Block 2: Secondary Incident Risk)
========================================================================================
Per-INCIDENT models, a third grain alongside train_incident_models.py's per-day
pipeline and train_incident_spatial_models.py's per-exit one:

  1. Ordinal Logistic Regression + XGBoost — compete on predicting an
     incident's SEVERITY (Property-Damage-Only / Injury / Fatal), from
     pre-incident context only (cause, type, weather, corridor position,
     time). Champion = whichever holds up better on a chronological holdout.

  2. Cox Proportional Hazards — survival-analyses the CLEARANCE duration
     (site_cleared - event_start_date, a real elapsed time now — see the
     data-source note below), the source for the clearance survival curve
     and the predicted-clearance-time output.

  3. A small logistic regression scoring "secondary incident risk": did
     another incident start nearby, before this one's clearance window
     closed? That label doesn't exist in the source data — it is derived
     here from a spatiotemporal self-join (see label_secondary_incidents()).

Data source (rebuilt on the accident_data event export — see below for the
two gaps this closes relative to the old nlex_road_crashes/
nlex_motorcycle_crashes source):
  silver.nlex_accident_events_clean carries REAL, recorded
  number_of_injured / number_of_fatality counts (unlike nlex_road_crashes /
  nlex_motorcycle_crashes, whose `severity` column is 100% NULL on every
  row). Severity is still DERIVED from those counts (0 -> PDO, injuries only
  -> Injury, any fatality -> Fatal, the standard KABCO-style taxonomy), but
  the counts themselves are now genuine, not an always-empty placeholder.
  Those same injury/fatality columns are consequences of the accident, not
  causes, so they stay excluded from the FEATURE set below on pain of
  leaking the label into its own predictors.

  This table also carries a real scene-cleared timestamp, site_cleared —
  unlike the old tables, which had no clearance column at all (only
  reported_time/response_time, the same pair
  src/services/incident.service.ts's RESPONSE_MIN computes minutes from for
  the descriptive dashboard, and which this script used to reuse as a
  "time to clear" proxy). `duration_min` below is now
  site_cleared - event_start_date: a real elapsed-time-to-clear, not a
  proxy — every caption downstream can honestly say "clearance time"
  instead of "response duration".

Only accident_data (silver.nlex_accident_events_clean) feeds this script.
breakdown_data (silver.nlex_breakdown_events_clean) is excluded: mechanical
breakdowns carry no injury/fatality information at all, so mixing it in
would just be rows of missing severity labels — the same reason
nlex_stalled_vehicles was excluded from the old version of this script. Its
per-service dispatch/response records (`deployments`) feed a separate,
purely descriptive analysis (getEventBreakdownFromDb / /api/incident/event-breakdown)
rather than this trained-model pipeline.

Usage:
    python train_incident_severity_models.py                 # train + report only
    python train_incident_severity_models.py --write-db       # + write to gold.*
    python train_incident_severity_models.py --dry-write       # rehearse the write, then roll back
