SmartFlow NLEX — Incident Predictive Pipeline (Phase B: 7-model comparison)
============================================================================
Walk-forward validated comparison of 7 forecasting approaches for daily
incident counts:
  1. XGBoost regressor          5. Poisson GLM
  2. Random Forest regressor    6. Negative Binomial GLM
  3. LSTM (small RNN)           7. SARIMAX (weekly seasonal, calendar exog)
  4. GRU  (small RNN)

3-fold expanding-window walk-forward validation (never trains on data from
after its own test window). Champion = lowest mean validation MAE among
models with MASE <= 1.0 (i.e. must beat a naive same-day-last-week baseline);
if every model fails that bar, the least-bad one is still picked so the
pipeline can produce output, but this is flagged loudly in the printout.

Two-phase by design:
  Phase 1 (always runs): walk-forward CV for all 7 models, prints the full
    comparison table, and STOPS. No DB writes here.
  Phase 2 (only with --write-db): refits the champion on the full dataset,
    generates the validation-window + future-window predictions, and writes
    ml_daily_actuals / ml_predictive_incidents / ml_training_metadata in one
    transaction — same 3-table contract as run_predictive_pipeline.py.

run_predictive_pipeline.py (single XGBoost baseline) is left untouched as a
fallback/reference until this is verified end to end.

Usage:
    .venv/Scripts/python.exe train_incident_models.py             # train + compare + print only
    .venv/Scripts/python.exe train_incident_models.py --write-db  # + write champion to DB

# autocorrelation on the combined incident series: lag_364 = 0.380, vs 0.312 at
# lag_365 and ~0.367 at lag_357/371 — the peak sits exactly on 364 days (52 weeks),
# i.e. the SAME WEEKDAY last year, not the same calendar date. December averages
# 33.9 incidents/day against August's 22.7, so the annual shape is real.
YOY_LAG = 364  # 52 weeks — keeps day-of-week aligned across the year boundary

# Exposure: how much traffic was on the road that day.
#
# An incident needs a vehicle to happen to, so the count is partly a function of
# how many vehicles there were — the rest of the feature set describes *when* a
# day is, but nothing described *how busy* it was. Measured on the joined series
# (2,398 days, 2020-01-01..2026-07-25 — a since-changed state of the table; on
# what it holds now, 2022-01-01..2025-12-31, r = +0.469): Pearson r = +0.720
# against daily incidents, and the relationship is monotonic across volume quintiles —
# 16.2 incidents/day in the lowest fifth rising to 36.6 in the highest. Volume
# alone regresses to R2 = 0.518, against 0.0016 for rainfall.
#
# Both columns are knowable in advance, which is what makes them legal here:
# history comes from gold.ml_predictive_volume.actual_volume and the forecast
# window from that same table's is_future rows — the traffic module's own
# published volume forecast, not a number this model would lack at inference.
# Both columns are transforms of volume, not the raw count, and the reason is
# numerical rather than stylistic. Raw volume runs to ~3e5 while every other
# feature here sits between 0 and 40; feeding that to the log-link GLMs makes
# exp(B.x) overflow, which measurably happened — NegBinomial_GLM failed outright
# on NaN and SARIMAX diverged to 1e38 before this was changed.
#
#   log_volume      — ln(volume). For a Poisson/NegBinomial log link this is the
#                     natural form: a coefficient near 1.0 states that incidents
#                     scale proportionally with traffic, which is the hypothesis
#                     being tested rather than an arbitrary rescale. Monotonic,
#                     so tree splits are unaffected by the transform.
#   volume_ratio_7  — volume over its trailing 7-day mean, centred on 1.0. Says
#                     "how busy is today for this week" — a surge term the level
#                     alone cannot express. Kept as a ratio rather than a second
#                     log level because two log levels would correlate ~0.95 and
#                     put collinear columns into the GLM design matrix.
