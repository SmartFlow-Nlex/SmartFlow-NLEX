-- GOLD: what a jam typically looks like at each exit, hour and day type.
--
-- The congestion forecast says WHETHER an exit is expected to jam in a given
-- hour. The live map says much more about a jam that exists: how long the
-- queue is, how far from the plaza it starts, and how many minutes it costs.
-- This table lets the forecast say the same things, from four years of Waze
-- history: for every exit x weekday/weekend x hour x severity, the median
-- queue length, distance from the plaza, delay and speed of the jams that
-- actually formed there.
--
-- SOURCE. silver.waze_jam_hourly_exit, the Jan 2022 - Apr 2026 Partner Hub
-- export rolled up to exit-hours (see the 29 Sep 2026 load). Only
-- on_corridor rows are used: that flag is the live map's own "this street is
-- the NLEX mainline" test, so a profile never describes a queue on a service
-- road the map would not draw. Each exit-hour can arrive as two rows (at the
-- exit, and further out); they are combined weighted by jam_snapshots, which
-- is exposure time.
--
-- NEAR THE EXIT ONLY (distance_m_avg <= 600). The export assigns every jam to
-- its nearest exit however far away it is, so Mexico's "typical queue" came
-- out at 2.9 km from jams three kilometres up the road, against 381 m in the
-- live feed. The live feed only attaches jams that touch the exit's stretch
-- (ON_CORRIDOR: median 107 m, 90th percentile 580 m from the plaza). Scored on
-- the live weeks, the typical queue error was:
--     every on-corridor jam      34 m   (and a 452 m mean, from those exits)
--     within 250 m (at_exit)     28 m
--     within 600 m               21 m   <- used
--     within 1000 m              22 m
-- An exit with too few near-plaza jams in history gets no profile rather than
-- one built from somewhere else.
--
-- SEVERITY uses the forecast's own cuts (train_congestion_horizon.py,
-- SEVERE_KMH = 10, HEAVY_KMH = 20) on the length-weighted speed, so a cell the
-- forecast paints red is matched with the jams that were red.
--
-- distance_m is from the jam's matched point to the nearest exit and has no
-- sign: history carries no carriageway, so it cannot say "before" or "past"
-- the plaza the way the live map does from a jam's geometry. The card words it
-- as "from" the plaza for that reason.
--
-- ROWS. Four levels, so the API can fall back when an hour is thin:
--   (exit, day_type, hour, state)   the specific case
--   (exit, day_type, hour, 'Any')   that hour, any severity
--   (exit, 'all',   NULL, state)    the exit, that severity, any hour
--   (exit, 'all',   NULL, 'Any')    the exit overall
-- plus exit_name = 'ALL' rows (corridor-wide, by severity), used only as the
-- baseline the evaluation below has to beat.
--
-- EVALUATION. gold.congestion_jam_profile_eval scores the profile against the
-- live feed (silver.fact_waze_jams, from 4 Aug 2026), which the history never
-- saw: for every live exit-hour with an NLEX jam, the profile's queue and
-- delay for that exit, hour, day type and observed severity, against what
-- Waze reported. It is compared with two simpler guesses: the corridor-wide
-- median for that severity, and the exit's median regardless of hour.
--
-- Idempotent: both tables are dropped and rebuilt. Re-run after any reload of
-- silver.waze_jam_hourly_exit:
--   npx tsx scripts/run-sql.ts scripts/medallion/11-gold-congestion-jam-profile.sql
