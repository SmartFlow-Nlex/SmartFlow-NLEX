 * TLS settings for the connection.

 * AWS RDS requires an encrypted connection (an unencrypted attempt is refused
 * by pg_hba with "no encryption"), but it presents a regional intermediate CA
 * that is not in Node's bundled trust store — so strict verification fails with
 * "self-signed certificate in certificate chain" even though the server is
 * genuine. "relaxed" encrypts the traffic while skipping chain verification.
 *
 * Note the tradeoff: relaxed mode protects against passive eavesdropping but
 * not against an active man-in-the-middle. To get full protection, download the
 * RDS CA bundle for your region and point PG_CA_CERT at it, then set
 * PG_SSL_MODE=verify.

 * connection and failed with "timeout exceeded when trying to connect", while a
 * fresh client from the same machine connected in under half a second. Every
 * dashboard read "Live data unavailable" until the server was restarted.
 *
 * So the pool is watched: three connect timeouts inside two minutes and it is
 * replaced with a fresh one — what a restart did, without one. Callers keep
 * importing `db` as before; it forwards to whichever pool is current. During a
 * real outage this just retries with a new pool at most every couple of
