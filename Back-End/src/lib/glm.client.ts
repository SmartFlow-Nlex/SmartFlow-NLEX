   GLM CLIENT

   One place that knows how to talk to Z.ai, so the sandbox command parser and
   the narrative generator cannot drift apart on timeouts, error mapping or the
   thinking-mode workaround.

   The endpoint is OpenAI-compatible, which is why this is plain fetch and not
   an SDK: pointing GLM_BASE_URL at any other OpenAI-shaped server (Ollama's
   /v1, OpenRouter, a self-hosted vLLM) is then a config change rather than a
   rewrite.
