/* Route-level cache for GET JSON responses.
 *
 * Eight more endpoints measured slow after the first three were cached by
 * hand -- /incident/severity at 120 s cold and 14 s warm, weather-speed at
 * 19 s, emissions/forecast at 8 s, weather-evidence at 4.5 s -- and every one
 * of them reads tables that change only when a script re-runs. Wrapping
 * each controller individually does not scale and misses the next route
 * someone adds, so this sits once on /api and applies to any successful GET.
 *
 * Behaviour:
 *   - TTL by path prefix: live feeds 30 s, everything else 10 min.
 *   - Single-flight: concurrent misses for one URL share one handler run.
 *   - Stale-while-revalidate: an expired entry is served immediately and a
 *     background self-request refreshes it, so after the first fill no user
 *     waits on a slow query.
 *   - Writes invalidate: any non-GET under a prefix clears that prefix, so a
 *     PATCH to /maintenance/:id/status is followed by a fresh list.
 *   - Only 200 JSON bodies are stored; errors and 401s pass through untouched,
 *     and so does anything a route behind authenticateToken answers.
 *   - x-cache-bypass: 1 skips the cache and refills it (the refresher and the
 *     warmer use it).
