 * Demand profile for the AI Sandbox.
 *
 * The sandbox used to run at a single inflow figure derived as
 * (total volume / days / 24) x 1.6, where 1.6 was an assumed peaking factor
 * that nobody had checked. The warehouse holds the real shape: hourly volume
 * per interchange per direction, split by vehicle class, over four years. At
 * Balintawak northbound it runs from 1,226 veh/h at 03:00 to 4,892 at 19:00 —
 * a peak-to-mean ratio of 1.89, not 1.6 — and the class mix swings just as
 * hard, from 1.6% heavy vehicles at 06:00 to 12.4% at 02:00. Freight runs at
 * night and cars run at rush hour, and a simulation given one flat mix cannot
 * reproduce either.
 *
 * Serving the measured profile replaces two assumptions with observations, and
 * lets the sandbox answer the question an operator actually has: not "what
 * happens at this flow" but "at which hour does this closure cost least".

 * Mainline flow, from toll transactions.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS EXISTS TO FIX
 * The sandbox anchored its inflow to the volume recorded at the NEAREST
 * interchange. That is an on-ramp figure, not a through-flow: at Balintawak
 * (km 0, the corridor's gateway) the two happen to be close, but eight
 * kilometres north at Meycauayan the plaza records 211 veh/h northbound while
 * the mainline past it carries roughly 2,900. The sandbox was simulating the
 * slip road and calling it the expressway, and it got quietly worse the
 * further along the corridor the operator looked.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS COMPUTABLE
 * gold.fact_traffic_hourly stores ONE ROW PER TOLLED TRIP, at the plaza where
 * the transaction happened — entry for the open system, exit for the closed
 * one (see Back-End/src/etl/canonical-exit.ts). So `role` is not a clean
 * entry/exit split of every movement, and an origin-destination matrix cannot
 * be recovered from it.
 *
 * What CAN be recovered is a conservation count. Every northbound entry south
 * of a point put a vehicle onto the carriageway; every northbound exit south
 * of it took one off. The difference is the flow crossing that point:
 *
 *     mainline(x) = SUM(entries at km <= x) - SUM(exits at km <= x)     [NB]
 *
 * and mirrored for southbound. This is exact wherever both sides are
 * transacted. On the southern open-system stretch exits are untolled and so
 * unrecorded, which makes the figure an UPPER BOUND there rather than an
 * equality — but the first northbound off-ramp is CDV/PH Arena at km 14.05,
 * so for anything south of that nothing has left yet and the bound is tight.
 *
 * Km-posts are not in the warehouse (silver.nlex_exit_reference carries
 * lat/long only), so this returns per-plaza volumes and the caller, which has
 * the km table, does the ordering and the cumulative sum.

 * southbound there, and the other way round, spread over the hours at which

 * Checked against the tickets: northbound, the open system's paid entries less
 * the trips that carry on into the closed one leave about 65,000 exits a day to
