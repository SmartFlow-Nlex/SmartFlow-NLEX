/**
 * The corridor drawn as two carriageways, coloured by what is happening on each.
 *
 * Waze only emits a jam where there IS one, so drawing the feed alone leaves the
 * road invisible between them — scattered coloured fragments over blank map. The
 * corridor itself comes from silver.dim_location, which holds the 19 exit-to-exit
 * segments and their geometry, so every segment is drawn whether or not it is
 * congested, and absence of a jam reads as clear rather than as missing road.
 *
 * Both directions are returned on the same centreline. Separating them is the
 * map's job, not the database's: Mapbox offsets each ribbon in screen pixels, so
 * the gap stays readable at every zoom and both sides trace the identical curve.
 * Offsetting here instead produced two subtly different lines and broke wherever
 * a segment doubled back on itself.
 *
 * Segments carry only their endpoints, so what this returns is a chain of
 * straight chords between exits. The client replaces that geometry with the real
 * OSM alignment before drawing — see lib/corridor-shape.ts. The value here is the
 * per-segment STATE; the shape is a placeholder.
