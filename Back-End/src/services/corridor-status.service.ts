/**
 * Live per-exit corridor status, from the same Waze feed the Live Map uses.
 *
 * The Home tab's corridor diagram was driven by three hardcoded datasets. This
 * replaces them with the jams the ingester is writing into
 * silver.fact_waze_jams, which lands roughly every few minutes.
 *
 * Two things make this readable as a corridor status rather than a jam list:
 *
 *  - Absence is information. Waze only emits a jam record where there IS a jam,
 *    so an exit with no recent row is flowing freely, not missing data. Every
 *    exit therefore starts green and is darkened only by evidence.
 *
 *  - Direction comes from the jam's own geometry. The feed has no direction
 *    field, but each jam is a LINESTRING, so the bearing from its start point to
 *    its end point says which way the stalled traffic was pointing. NLEX runs
 *    roughly north-south, so a northward bearing is NB. Across the full history
 *    this splits 13.2k/14.1k NB/SB, which is the even split a bidirectional
 *    corridor should give and a decent check that the derivation is sound.
 *
 * NAMED_ONLY matches are excluded: those sit ~3.9 km from the corridor and were
 * matched on a street name alone, so they describe somewhere else.
 *
 * Jams must also be on NLEX by the name Waze gave them, the same test the map
 * applies before painting a ribbon. Position alone is not enough: the local road
 * network runs within metres of the corridor for most of its length, and
 * counting it made this panel disagree with the map about the whole road.

   MERGED CORRIDOR VIEW  (mobile clients)

   getCorridorStatus() above returns only the exits Waze reported a jam on —
   around ten rows out of forty exit/direction pairs. Rendering a corridor from
   it takes three rules that are not in the payload:

     1. absence means clear, so every pair starts green and is darkened only by
        evidence;
     2. the live rows join to the exit list by NAME, there being no exit id in
        the feed;
     3. a direction with no ramp is not clear, it is not a road — it draws as
        bare tarmac and is left out of the tally.

   The dashboard implements all three in the browser. A second client
   reimplementing them is a second chance to get them wrong, and the failure is
   quiet: the map still renders, it just disagrees with the dashboard about the
   road. So this resolves them once, server-side, and hands back every exit in
   both directions with its status already decided.

   The panel's own numbers are the specification here — the tally counts pairs
   with a ramp, which is why 20 exits give 40 pairs and the header adds up.
