/* ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   SCENARIO CONTEXT — THE PRESCRIPTIVE JOIN

   The three predictive modules each answer "what will happen" for their own
   quantity. The sandbox answers "what should we do about it". This is the seam:
   it takes one forecast date and returns what all three modules expect for that
   day, so a simulation can start from a predicted Tuesday rather than from an
   annual average.

   The dates offered are the ones the VOLUME and EMISSION forecasts both cover,
   because the volume forecast is what actually seeds the simulation. The
   horizons differ — volume and emissions store 90 future days, incidents
   currently 28 — so a date past the incident horizon is still offered, but its
   incident figures are returned as absent (covered: false) with a note saying
   so. They are never filled from a default or stretched from another date:
   a scenario is seeded only from what a model actually forecast for that day.
   When the incident model's horizon grows, the covered range grows with it.

   Nothing here decides policy. It reports what was forecast and how accurate
   each forecast has been; the operator decides what to simulate against it.

 * physically carry (~2,000/lane/hour), so the simulation simply saturated and
 * every scenario looked identically gridlocked regardless of the forecast.
 *
 * Without an origin-destination matrix the honest approximation is the busiest
 * plaza's share of corridor volume — the load at the heaviest point on the road,
 * which is where a closure is worth simulating. The share used is returned in
