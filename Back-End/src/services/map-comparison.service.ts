 * byte-identical to the +12h one - so the panel said so rather than offering a
 * control that would move nothing. The retrained model does vary, and the
 * panel offers the control again on the strength of this flag.
 *
 * `maxHorizon` is what the table actually reaches, which is not the same as
 * what the model can serve: the pipeline writes as many hours ahead as it was
 * asked for, and the UI must not offer a range the warehouse cannot answer.
