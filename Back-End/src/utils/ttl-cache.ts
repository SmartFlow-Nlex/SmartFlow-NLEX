/* A small in-memory cache with two properties the slow endpoints need.
 *
 * TTL: the forecast tables change only when a training script re-runs, the
 * live feed is a 60-minute window, and the RDS instance behind them is small
 * (shared_buffers ~88 MB, 77% cache hit) -- the same query measured at 13 ms
 * and at 15 s depending on what the disk was doing. Serving a recent answer
 * from memory both cuts latency and keeps repeat work off that instance.
 *
 * Single-flight: three cards on one tab request the same payload within the
 * same second. Without coalescing, a cold cache runs the work three times and
 * the third caller waits longest. Concurrent callers for one key share one
 * in-flight promise.
 *
 * Failures are never cached: a rejected promise is dropped so the next caller
 * retries rather than replaying an error for the whole TTL.

 * slow connection, a query racing a concurrent migration) into a frozen
 * outage for the whole window: every request in that window replays the
