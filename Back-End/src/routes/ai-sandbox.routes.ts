 * unauthenticated, and gating this one alone would leave the sandbox's command
 * box permanently 401ing while the rest of the page worked.
 *
 * It is a safe thing to leave open in the sense that it reads nothing and
 * writes nothing: it takes a sentence plus the browser's own simulation state
 * and returns a proposed action list. It does cost tokens per call, so it moves
 * behind authenticateToken along with the rest of the dashboard as soon as the
 * frontend carries a session.
